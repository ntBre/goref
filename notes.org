* TODOS
** TODO Work on WriteFZFList
   - this will be useful even while nothing else works
   - just pipe this file into fzf and have most of the functionality I want
** TODO fzf integration
   - have SearchString so just need to pipe them in
** TODO handle resources like books, incollection, etc
** TODO continue adding test cases from problems in whole refs.bib
** TODO testing of add/edit methods
   - maybe the interface will handle the interesting parts
** TODO work on TUI
   - go build . && st -e ./goref
     - seems like a good way to test

* Goal Features
  - TUI for adding, editing references, probably either
    - https://github.com/marcusolsson/tui-go
    - https://github.com/rivo/tview <- prob this one
  - Tagging system, cite by tag
    - ex) tag LYP86, LYP88, and B3 with :b3lyp: tag, :cite b3lyp -> \cite{LYP86, LYP88, B3}
  - Fuzzy find on all fields
    - ex) /for11dipole matches Fortenberry11dbs

* Ideas/notes
  - check for duplicate keys, everything else is probably okay not unique
  - might want to join the whole reference on one line to avoid line break stuff
    - should also help with fuzzy finding if I already have this mechanism
  - need to make curly braces optional in reading
    - separate read initial and normal read since after init they should be written by me?
    - take into account other possible delimiters like quotes
    - could just be opinionated about how the initial refs should be laid out
  - Add/edit methods for all fields of ref - not sure I need remove

* Done
** DONE relax input reading constraints -> adjust regex, \s* for newlines, just look for end brace
   - case insensitive
