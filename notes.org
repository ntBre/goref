* Goal Features
  - TUI for adding, editing references
  - Tagging system, cite by tag
    - ex) tag LYP86, LYP88, and B3 with :b3lyp: tag, :cite b3lyp -> \cite{LYP86, LYP88, B3}
  - Fuzzy find on all fields
    - ex) /for11dipole matches Fortenberry11dbs

* Ideas/notes
  - might want to join the whole reference on one line to avoid line break stuff
    - should also help with fuzzy finding if I already have this mechanism
  - need to make curly braces optional in reading 
    - take into account other possible delimiters like quotes
    - could just be opinionated about how the initial refs should be laid out
